# Produce an evidence-grounded maintainer note showing executor/evaluator/acceptance environments, the exact trust boundary, unsupported required environments, and claims not established by Docker smoke evidence

> **Why:** Produce an evidence-grounded maintainer note showing executor/evaluator/acceptance environments, the exact trust boundary, unsupported required environments, and claims not established by Docker smoke evidence. Cite verified source symbols and state remaining uncertainty.

## Goal

Produce an evidence-grounded maintainer note showing executor/evaluator/acceptance environments, the exact trust boundary, unsupported required environments, and claims not established by Docker smoke evidence. Cite verified source symbols and state remaining uncertainty.

## Context

Produce an evidence-grounded maintainer note showing executor/evaluator/acceptance environments, the exact trust boundary, unsupported required environments, and claims not established by Docker smoke evidence. Cite verified source symbols and state remaining uncertainty.

## Behavior

- **B-1** — GIVEN the registered repository issue and fixed authorized scope WHEN the bounded implementation is independently evaluated THEN the declared behavior passes without modifying unrelated files or promoting reported evidence
- **B-2** — GIVEN the recorded evidence and authorization boundary WHEN the candidate is checked THEN source evidence is unchanged and no unrelated write is present

## Success Criteria

```bash
# eval_1: Independent behavioral proof for investigation
eval_1() {
  /Users/luanmorenomaciel/GitHub/task-spec/.taskspec/runtime/decompose/bin/python /Users/luanmorenomaciel/GitHub/task-spec/tests/evals/toolkit/evaluate_issue.py investigation --root .
}

# eval_2: Declared write surface only
eval_2() {
  /Users/luanmorenomaciel/GitHub/task-spec/.taskspec/runtime/decompose/bin/python /Users/luanmorenomaciel/GitHub/task-spec/tests/evals/toolkit/evaluate_issue.py write-boundary --root .
}

# eval_3: Registered issue evidence is unchanged
eval_3() {
  /Users/luanmorenomaciel/GitHub/task-spec/.taskspec/runtime/decompose/bin/python /Users/luanmorenomaciel/GitHub/task-spec/tests/evals/toolkit/evaluate_issue.py source-integrity --root .
}

```

## Validation Card

```yaml

    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    verifies: [B-2]
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: 120

```

## Exit Check

```bash
eval_1 && eval_2 && eval_3
```

## Rollback Plan

Revert only this isolated candidate change.

## Observability Hooks

Retained provider output, evaluation result, and prospective event journal.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not modify the evaluator or authorize additional work.

## Do-Not-Touch

- `tests/fixtures/toolkit/pilot-issue.json`
- `tasks`

## Open Questions

(none — this task is fully specified)
